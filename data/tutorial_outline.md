**GitHub for Beginners: Interactive Tutorial Outline**

**1. Introduction to Git and GitHub**
   - What is Git?
     - Visualize Git as a version timeline that tracks file changes.
   - What is GitHub?
     - Demonstrate how GitHub is like a remote library for sharing code.
   - Understanding key terms: repository, commit, clone, push, pull.
     - Use visuals to introduce each term and show their relationships.

**2. Setting Up Your Environment**
   - Installing Git on your computer.
     - Interactive steps showing different OS installations.
   - Creating a GitHub account.
     - Visualize the account setup and explain the GitHub dashboard.

**3. Creating Your First Repository**
   - Local vs Remote repositories.
     - Show a side-by-side comparison with an animated diagram.
   - Initializing a repository.
     - Visualize how "git init" sets up tracking for a project.
   - Creating and pushing your first commit.
     - Show the flow from editing files to creating a commit.

**4. Understanding Branching**
   - What is a branch and why do we use it?
     - Animate the branching flow: main branch vs new branches.
   - Creating and switching branches.
     - Show branches diverging and merging on a timeline.
   - Merging branches back into the main branch.
     - Visualize how history changes when branches are merged.

**5. Collaborating on GitHub**
   - Cloning repositories.
     - Demonstrate the process visually, showing the clone flowing from GitHub to local.
   - Forking and Pull Requests.
     - Show the difference between a fork and a branch.
     - Visualize the pull request process and how changes are integrated.
   - Working with remotes.
     - Explain the concepts of "origin" and tracking remote branches visually.

**6. Handling Conflicts**
   - What are merge conflicts?
     - Use an example to show how conflicts occur when multiple changes collide.
   - How to resolve conflicts.
     - Demonstrate conflict resolution interactively, showing the before and after of files.

**7. Useful Git Commands & Best Practices**
   - Common commands: status, log, diff, etc.
     - Use visuals to show how these commands help track progress.
   - Best practices for commit messages and branch names.
     - Interactive scenarios to emphasize clarity and meaningful commits.

**8. Using GitHub for Project Management**
   - Issues and Projects in GitHub.
     - Visualize using Issues to track tasks.
